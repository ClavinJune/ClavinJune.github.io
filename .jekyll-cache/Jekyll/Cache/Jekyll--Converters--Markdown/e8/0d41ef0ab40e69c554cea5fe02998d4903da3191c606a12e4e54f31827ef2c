I"ô<p>Data serialization library in Java could be varied. You can use Jackson, GSON, or anything else. Since there are too many serialization libraries out there, itâ€™s quite tricky to manage Java class attribute exclusion during serialization. Each library might have their own way to exclude the Java class attribute. Each Java project should only have 1 serialization library in order to maintain the standardization but, what if somehow in someway you need more than one serialization library?</p>
