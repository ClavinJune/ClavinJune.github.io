<p><a href="https://clavinjune.dev/blog/">This blog</a> is the result of my learning journey about a static-site generator made on top of <a href="https://jekyllrb.com/">Jekyll</a>. The design is kinda bad due to my lacked sense of design. To avoid creating a whole trash blog, I tried to ask my friends to give me feedback about the design a bit.</p>

<p>I have tried using the provided theme like <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/minima">Minima</a> but, I just donâ€™t like it after all. Thatâ€™s why I think itâ€™s better to create my own. I tried to create the simplest design as long as it is easy to be read. I used <a href="https://coolors.co/">Coolors</a>, <a href="https://fonts.google.com/">Google Font</a>, <a href="http://rouge.jneen.net/">Rogue</a>, <a href="https://github.com/sverrirs/jekyll-paginate-v2">Jekyll Paginate</a>, <a href="https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-feed">Jekyll Feed</a>, and write a bit of Ruby, CSS, and JS for creating the theme itself. I didnâ€™t think creating this simple blog costs me 2 Saturdays, even though it only consists of as many as 3 pages.</p>

<p>After I think the whole template is ready to be published, I create <a href="https://github.com/anon-org/jekyll-blog">this template repository</a> just in case thereâ€™s someone who wants to try Jekyll using my template. It is ready to be deployed, just adjust <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">_config.yaml</code> a bit and a whole blog is ready with itâ€™s auto-generated RSS feeds.</p>

<p>Integrating blog posts to <a href="https://dev.to">DEV</a> using RSS is not a new thing. But this is a new experience for me since I only write two posts on DEV before. Despite this is a new blog, I have written my thoughts at <a href="https://medium.com/@ClavinJune">Medium</a>. I was looking for a way to publish to Medium via RSS feeds, but I didnâ€™t find any. Luckily DEV supports this kind of thing with simple configuration, perhaps I need to adjust the post a bit before publishing it.</p>

<p>Perhaps Iâ€™m gonna try to integrate this blog using <a href="https://webmention.io/">Webmention</a> and <a href="https://webmonetization.org/">Web Monetization</a> after getting a bunch of visitors, but Iâ€™m gonna save it for later.</p>

<p>Thank you for reading, all feedbacks and comments are more than welcome!</p>
